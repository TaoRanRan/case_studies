# Random Scripts Collection 

Welcome to this chaotic yet maybe entertaining collection of scripts! 🧩 These scripts cover a variety of topics, from machine learning models to data analysis, and everything in between. None of these are meant for serious use—just a bunch of old, fun, and experimental pieces from the past. Feel free to explore, modify, or laugh at the code.
